# SteamGameVisualisation

These are python applications to make a mosaic/desktop background of your steam games
Just copy/paste your steam api key into the key variable slot and run what program you want.

The steamAsyn program is the faster of the two basic programs, enter your vanity or regular steam id and watch it run. This will produce a 16x9 picture of all your games.

The program steamAsp will ask your id then after fetching images it will ask you your desired aspect ratio, enter it in integerxinteger form like 16x9 or 4x3 or 16x10.

The program steampics no longer works and was a slower version of steam asyn that doesn't process the request with pythons asyn library.
